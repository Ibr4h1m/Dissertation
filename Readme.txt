Hello,

Thank you for viewing my code for AutoCab. Please note the following:

- To register a new user, you need an activation code which is 'ActivationCode'.
- By default, users are registered with rank 1, which is staff level.
- Rank 2 is admin level, you have to set it manually from the database.
- I've named this prototype after the purpose of automating tasks, hence why it is called 'AutoCab' (Automated Cab Management).

Issues:
- Nav.php is the navigation links which I included in every page. This should work fine on localhost, but if you are having issues with the navigation, please change the nav.php root path according to your directory.
- db_connect.php is where the connection is established with the database. My database is called Autocab (SQL file is in the folder, you just need to import it.)

Credentials (Manager):
username: admin
password: admin

Credentials (Staff):
username: staff
password: staff

Thank you,
Ibrahim
